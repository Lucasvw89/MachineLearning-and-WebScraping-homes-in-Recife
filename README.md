# MachineLearning-and-WebScraping-homes-in-Recife

Using webscraping to gather my own data to use in my machine learning model

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is mainly to learn more about Machine Learning and Web Scraping.

# Libraries used

when making this project, the libraries that I used Where:
- Selenium (WebScraping)
- Pandas (Data)
- Scikit-learn (MachineLearning)

# The Program

In the folder called "outras_amostras" I made the python files that access the website named "chaves na mao" to gather information about homes in Recife (Brazil) like size, location, number of bedrooms...

Using the .CSV files created by the WebScraping, I then made the Machine Learning Model.

First using only the numeric data acquired (margin of error: about R$ 316.000,00)
then using all the data with OneHotEncoding (margin of error: about R$ 260.000,00)
